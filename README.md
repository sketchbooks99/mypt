- Simple path tracer implemented by C++/OpenMP. 
- For future work, I'd like to implement several techniques for efficient rendering, such as, next event estimation, multiple importance sampling. I also plan to implement several rendering and/or sampling strategies (i.e., MLT, BDPT, Sobol, Uniform sampling).
- If I finished basic learning of path tracing, I'd like to implement GPU path tracing techniques using OptiX or CUDA.
- Currently, this doesn't support spectrum rendering, so all color management is performed by RGB representation.
